# Potion

Potion is a reverse-engineered API for [Notion](https://notion.so). Write your content in Notion, and use Potion's hosted API endpoints to read your content.

**I no longer maintain Potion, since the [official Notion API](https://developers.notion.com) has been released and is more stable than Notionâ€™s internal API, which Potion relies on.**

## Guides

I've written a couple of blog posts on my website for using this API.

* [How to use Notion as your blog's CMS](https://benborgers.com/blog/notion-blog)
* [API to read a Notion table](https://benborgers.com/blog/notion-table)
* [How to turn a Notion doc into a website](https://benborgers.com/blog/notion-to-website)

## Endpoints

All endpoints are relative to the base URL: `https://potion-api.now.sh`

Responses are cached for 10 seconds, so it'll take up to 10 seconds for changes made in Notion to show up.

*`<notion-page-id>` refers to the 32 character alphanumeric string in the URL of a Notion doc (but not a query parameter, so not the string after `?v=`).*

### /table

Lists all entries in a full-page Notion table, along with additional details about each page.

The only query parameter is `?id=<notion-page-id>`.

### /table-description

Generates HTML for the description of a table.

The only query parameter is `?id=<notion-page-id>`.

### /html

Generates HTML for a given Notion page. You can insert it as the contents of a blog post, for example.

The only query parameter is `?id=<notion-page-id>`, which can be obtained from the `/table` endpoint or just by copy-and-pasting from the URL.

## Syntax Highlighting

Potion gives you syntax highlighting of Notion code blocks for free, when using the `/html` endpoint!

### How to use syntax highlighting

You'll notice that the code block HTML that Potion returns is given CSS classes that make it compatible with [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/).

1. Pick a theme you like from [this README](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes/blob/master/README.md).
2. Select the CSS file for that theme [from this list](https://unpkg.com/browse/prism-themes@latest/themes/) and click **View Raw**.
3. Include that stylesheet in the `head` of your HTML page to activate syntax highlighting. For example:
  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/prism-themes@1.4.0/themes/prism-ghcolors.css" />
  ```

### Language support

Potion supports syntax highlighting for most popular languages, and you can open an issue if you'd like to see a language supported that isn't currently.


## Limitations

Most, but not all, of the common Notion blocks are supported at the moment:

- [x] Text
- [x] To-do List
- [x] Heading 1
- [x] Heading 2
- [x] Heading 3
- [x] Bulleted List
- [x] Numbered List
- [ ] Toggle List
- [x] Quote
- [x] Divider
- [ ] Link to Page
- [x] Callout
- [x] Image
- [x] Embed
- [ ] Web Bookmark
- [x] Video
- [ ] Audio
- [x] Code
- [ ] File
- [x] Math Equation
- [x] Inline Equation
